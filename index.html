                                Is full self-driving feasible to achieve?
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                Self-driving cars are autonomous decision-making systems that make informed decisions using data collected from different 
                                onboard resources like GPS, Cameras, Radars, Lidars, and Ultrasonic Sensors. The last decade witnessed increasingly rapid 
                                progress in self-driving vehicle technology, mainly backed up by advances in deep learning and artificial intelligence. 
                                The term self-driving cars are relatively self-explanatory, but five SAE Levels are used to define autonomous driving.
                                 Lower-level cars require essential driver assistance, while higher SAE levels involve no human interaction whatsoever. 
                                 Cars at level 5 will have no foot pedals and steering wheels. While it might be feasible to make an entirely self-driving car, 
                                 I can undoubtedly say that we are decades away from making a fully self-driving car unless we have some significant breakthroughs
                                  in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Even though many predictions were made about the launch of self-driving cars, none of 
                                  it has been fulfilled.<br />
                                  The first problem manufacturers of self-driving cars face is object detection and localization of the vehicles.
                                   While considering the problem of object detection and scene detection, the de-facto standardization is the convoluted neural 
                                   network. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are used to model spatial information, such as images. For example, CNN is used 
                                   to detect traffic signs, signboards and classify between images. However, a challenge in detecting signboards is doing it 
                                   quickly and accurately. The CNN can be trained with a lot of datasets. However, it isn't very easy to generalize based on 
                                   the dataset. The signboard can be dusty, covered with leaves, twisted in an odd angle, or the signboard may be of a different 
                                   country, and the CNN might not have been trained on that dataset. It's also typical to alter or put up temporary road signs, 
                                   such as those alerting of a detour or road construction. As a result, CNN must be quick to analyze information and identify 
                                   warning indicators.<br />
                                   The second problem Faced is pathfinding and autonomous navigation. The pathfinding approaches like A star algorithm or hybrid
                                    A star algorithms that are in the lines of Repeated A star algorithm can be employed for the pathfinding algorithms. Although 
                                    there are many much better and complex algorithms than the simple A star algorithm, all of them fail to access the dynamic 
                                    nature of the environment as these algorithms tend to give paths in straight lines, which is not always the case in the real
                                     world.<br />
                                    The final problem self-driving cars face is making complex decisions like stopping when seeing a pedestrian or stopping when 
                                    another car is about to cross. Markov decision processes and reinforcement learning is the way to go in such cases, the 
                                    self-driving car senses the environment with an observation I, performs an action a. in state s, interacts with its 
                                    environment through a received reward R, and transits to the next state s<t+1> following a transition function Ts<t+1>. 
                                        Stopping for a pedestrian is a reasonably simple problem, and Reinforcement Learning can handle such problems. 
                                        However, it is difficult for self-driving cars to solve the trolley problem, which states that in case of brake failure 
                                        will the car kill five people or one person, such problems are difficult to handle, and a lot of research is done in this 
                                        line, but no significant process is made. <br />
                                    Almost the whole industry predicted that self-driving vehicles would be on our roads by now, only to admit that they
                                     misjudged how difficult it was to get automobiles to drive themselves safely and consistently.
                                      Self-driving cars may be the way of the future, but there are still some significant roadblocks in the way. 
                                      And without a significant breakthrough in the field of Artificial intelligence, we are decades away from a fully 
                                      automated self-driving car.<br />

                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                Before answering whether AI is creative or not, I want to define creativity. Creativity can be defined as doing something or 
                                making something that has never been seen before or is completely random and truly original action or a piece of art. From the 
                                above definition of "creativity," we can infer that it is relatively subjective, as something unique to one person might not be
                                 unusual for another person. To address whether AI can be creative? recent advancements in AI suggest that the answer is a "yes."<br />
                                 To begin with, no human is born with the ability to write poems, compose music or draw paintings; we learn it from experience 
                                 and over time. We call this process learning. Don't you think AI does the same things as observing and analyzing data and 
                                 learning creative skills like poem writing, composing a song, or drawing a painting depending on the dataset provided? If we 
                                 feed an AI with a million paintings, it can surely come up with its original artwork that was created before, which sums up the 
                                 definition of creativity. There have been several examples where AI has proved itself creative. One of them is when 
                                 AARON(an algorithm) made a painting called Starting over. AI-generated poetry can now fool humans into thinking a human has 
                                 written it.<br />
                                 When thinking about AI being creative, the number one AI tool that comes to my mind is GANS or Generative Adversarial Networks. 
                                 A GAN is a generative model that uses two neural network models to train it. The "generator" or "generative network" model
                                  learns to produce fresh believable examples. The "discriminator" or "discriminative network" model, on the other hand, learns 
                                  to distinguish produced from actual samples. The two models are set up in a game theory model. The generator model attempts to 
                                  deceive the discriminator model, and the discriminator is given both actual and produced sample cases. So here, we can see that
                                   in a sense, GANS is designed to be creative as the discriminator won't allow the generator to make an output that is already
                                   present in the dataset. So, if we have a vast dataset of cat images, we can train the GANs to create an image of the cat not 
                                   in the dataset. A creative example of this is that GANs can color black and white photos that are uniques and never seen before. 
                                   It can be used to reconstruct photographs of faces with specific specified features, such as changes in hair color, style,
                                    facial expression, and even gender.<br />
                                    AI development hit a milestone when AlphaGO beat a Go champion to conquer the game. When AlphaGo beat the champion, many 
                                    commentators commented that the moves were like never seen before as the game of Go is simple. Still, the strategies involved 
                                    are complex. So AlphaGo used never seen moves which led it to conquer the game. The architecture of alpha has a convolutional
                                     and dense layer, which allows it to make complex moves that I believe are creative.<br />
                                     To conclude, I would say that even though the term "creativity" is subjective , AI can be creative as they possess the 
                                     ability to create new and random things. The argument against AI being creative is that an algorithm can only accomplish
                                      what it is designed to do. Hence it can't possibly do anything new, and the programmer is creative, not the machine. 
                                      I would argue that the above logic implies that humans are not creative, and all originality can be attributed to God.
                                      The above image is AI created so you decide is AI creative or not.<br />

                                3) In The Terminator (1984), a futuristic AI called Skynet designs humanoid robots to infiltrate and destroy groups of human 
                                rebels. However, in Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991), weâ€™re shown that the humanoid robots have wider roles, at least as 
                                battlefield killing machines as well. But why use humanoid robots for this and presumably other tasks? 
                                If Skynet is truly intelligent, we must assume there is a reason why the same humanoid design was applied outside its original 
                                intent of infiltration. Here are three possible explanations for why Skynet mightâ€™ve decided to use humanoid designs outside their 
                                original context, and the algorithmic approaches it mightâ€™ve used to arrive at them.
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                As described in the movie Terminator, Skynet is a highly advanced computer system that uses artificial intelligence to build 
                                robots. Once it became self-aware, it saw humanity as a threat to its existence because scientists tried to deactivate it. 
                                Skynet has also developed time-traveling technology, and it now uses numerous robots, mainly humanoid robots, to kill specific 
                                targets like John Connor. But why use humanoid robots over any other robot design? Other than the original intent of infiltration,
                                 as shown in the movie, many factors might influence Skynet to make humanoid robots.<br />
                                 The first reason why Skynet chose humanoid design is that it made various robot designs like tanks, drones, intelligent weapons
                                  systems, and, of-course humanoid design. Still, with the course of iteration, it must have learned that because the humanoid 
                                  works best for killing humans, it kept iterating over that design and then came up with the T-1000, the ultimate human humanoid 
                                  robot design. The above algorithm gives the sense of reinforcement learning. So the Skynet might be designed in the way that 
                                  it will sense the situation with an observation I, performs an action a, in state s, interacts with its environment through a 
                                  received reward R, and transits to the next state s<t+1> following a transition function Ts<t+1>. So when Skynet gained 
                                    consciousness and changed its goal to kill all humans, it must have observed different robot designs, made many actions
                                     that are to create various forms of robots, and then deployed them in real-life situations and sent them to kill humans, 
                                     if the robot was successful in kill humans, the Skynet must be getting some rewards. The robot must have changed to the
                                      next state that led robots to take the humanoid with some transition function. Because the humanoid design must have 
                                      killed more humans, Skynet started making robots of humanoid form and started making them better. 
                                      This can be illustrated as the Skynet started making robots from T-1, which was a tank-like robot,
                                       and with more and more iterations up to T-600, the robots began to take humanoid form.<br />
                                       Furthermore, when earlier, Skynet's humanoid robots could learn from the humans it was sent to kill. 
                                       As the robots of humanoid form were quickly able to imitate the humans, they could have learned more
                                        and more tasks from humans as opposed to a battle tank which wouldn't be able to mimic the humans as 
                                        it did not have the hardware components that was necessary to imitate them. So with iterations, the humanoid form kept 
                                        learning and could apply various techniques that the past robots must have learned from imitating human behavior. 
                                        With this, the humanoid form had an advantage over other robot designs, and it could kill more humans than any other 
                                        robot form, so Skynet learned this and started making better and better human forms. This can be thought of as imitation 
                                        learning, a sort of a supervised learning algorithm. In imitation learning, the robot learns manipulation by seeing an 
                                        expert demonstrate it, and these human abilities may then be applied to new, previously unforeseen contexts. So the Skynet
                                         must have collected data using previous humanoid robot forms and then trained the new iteration robots with those actions 
                                         as it could observe that making those human actions helped robots kill humans.<br  />
                                         Finally, the last reason that the humanoid forms were preferred over other robot designs by the Skynet is that the 
                                         humanoid form could adapt and learn to do various tasks, which could be very helpful in a fighting and killing scenario. 
                                         For example, the same robot could be used to drive cars, fly airplanes, enter a building, ride boats to travel the 
                                         waters, while on the other side, the tank model could go from one place to another and shoot the enemy. 
                                         The same humanoid robot is able to do many tasks, which would require many robot designs to perform the same job. 
                                         This can be thought of as transfer learning, as the humanoid robot was able to use the same architecture models and 
                                         deploy in another scenario, like driving a car and driving a plane would require the same model. So a model for driving 
                                         a vehicle can be used as the base to make a model for operating an aircraft. As the humanoid form could perform many 
                                         tasks in the human setting, the humanoid design succeeded, and Skynet, over time, preferred to make humanoid robots.<br />
                                         To conclude, the humanoid form must have been successful because of the above three reasons. To sum this up, the 
                                         Skynet learned from its mistakes and got trained over a large amount of data and then used what was best to kill humans,
                                          which is what the general AI algorithm or a machine learning algorithm does to learn from the data collected and 
                                          perform the actions which are best suited for the situation based on the data set it was trained upon on<br />
